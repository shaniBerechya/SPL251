# Project Overview  

This project is a **distributed emergency messaging system** using the **STOMP protocol**. It includes a **Java-based server** and a **C++ client**, enabling users to **subscribe to emergency channels, report incidents, and receive updates** in real-time. The server supports two architectures: **Thread-Per-Client (TPC)** and **Reactor**, optimizing performance based on workload.  

## Required Skills & Knowledge  

- **âœ” Java Concurrency** â€“ Implementing multi-threaded **TPC** and **Reactor** servers.  
- **âœ” Network Programming** â€“ Socket communication using **STOMP (Simple-Text-Oriented Messaging Protocol)**.  
- **âœ” C++ Multithreading** â€“ Handling **keyboard input and server responses** in separate threads.  
- **âœ” Event-Driven Architecture** â€“ Message-based communication for **efficient client-server interaction**.  
- **âœ” JSON Parsing** â€“ Reading and formatting **emergency reports**.  
- **âœ” Unix Development** â€“ Compiling and testing with **Makefile (C++)** and **Maven (Java)**.  

## Theoretical Concepts Used  

- **ðŸ“Œ STOMP Protocol** â€“ Structuring **message frames** for client-server communication.  
- **ðŸ“Œ Asynchronous Messaging** â€“ **Subscription-based** event handling for real-time updates.  
- **ðŸ“Œ Reactor vs. Thread-Per-Client** â€“ Comparing **scalable event-driven** and **dedicated-thread** models.  
- **ðŸ“Œ Multi-Threaded Clients** â€“ Separating **input handling** and **network listening**.  
- **ðŸ“Œ Distributed System Design** â€“ Managing **message routing and user authentication**.  

This project demonstrates **real-time communication and distributed systems**, integrating **network programming, concurrency, and event-driven design**. ðŸš€
